# CP1404 Practicals Repository

## About Me

My name is Shuntong Wu, I am 21 years old and from China. I am currently studying Information Technology at James Cook University (JCU). This is my GitHub repository for the subject CP1404 â€“ Programming II, which includes various practical exercises, assignments, and code review practices completed during the course.

## Lessons Learned: Clean Code Practices

Throughout this subject, I have learned the importance of writing clean, maintainable, and professional code. Here are three key lessons I learned:

- **Write meaningful names**  
  Use descriptive variable and function names that clearly indicate their purpose. Avoid single-letter names (except for loop counters) and use snake_case for variables and functions.

- **Use docstrings and comments effectively**  
  Write concise and meaningful docstrings for all functions and classes. Comments should clarify the intent of complex code but should not state the obvious.

- **Avoid code duplication**  
  Follow the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle by using functions to encapsulate repeated logic, improving readability and maintainability.
