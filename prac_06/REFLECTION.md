# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I place greater emphasis on watching lecture videos before class. Previously, I was unable to preview them every week.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I also need to pay attention to code efficiency issues, rather than just implementing the final output and leaving a bunch of repeated checks.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I can devote a significant amount of time to this important subject. I can preview and review the material, complete my assignments, and resolve any questions I may have.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

As I mentioned in my last personal reflection, I am still unable to completely detach myself from the IDE when writing code. I need to practise more in this area, not only to prepare for the final exam.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I think everything is going well at the moment.
