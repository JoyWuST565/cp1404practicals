# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

90%

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

I usually watch the full lecture video at home before the start of each week's Lec.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I organize all the Python knowledge I learn into my own electronic notes every week, instead of just leaving it on the learnJCU website.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to gradually learn to write code with pen and paper. I currently rely too much on PyCharm's auto-correction and prompting features, which is not conducive to learning, not just for the pen and paper final exam.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

As mentioned in the previous question, I will basically use all the knowledge I have learned so far, but I may not be able to actively remember them, relying on looking through my notes or PyCharm's prompts and modifications.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

I don't dare to say that I did it very well, but I think I did it basically correct and complete.
